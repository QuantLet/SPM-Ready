Name of QuantLet: SPMsimase

Published in: Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models

Description: Shows the averaged squared error for the simulated data set with Gaussian (label 1) and quartic kernel (label 2). The weighted function w(u)=I(|u-0.5|<=0.4) was used. The binwidths h with minimal ASE (min1, min2) are computed.

Keywords: average squared error, quadratic kernel, simulation, gaussian, plot, graphical representation
